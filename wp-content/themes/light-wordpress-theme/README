Ubuntu-LoCo port for WordPress.
===============================

Website:
  http://launchpad.net/ubuntu-website
Launchpad:
  https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-website-community/ubuntu-website/light-wordpress-theme
Bzr:
  bzr branch lp:~ubuntu-website-community/ubuntu-website/light-wordpress-theme

This is a theme created for WordPress to be used
as the CMS engine for Ubuntu loco websites.

It uses the layout of the current (ubuntu-10.04) ubuntu 
website revised by lp:ubuntu-website team and contributors.

The software behind it is Thematic theme framework for
WordPress witch you gonna need. This is a child theme for
it, so It won't work without thematic!!!

There are also some plugins I used, especially to bring
some more control on the widgets and multilanguage versions.
Such plugins are:
 * qTranslate ( optional if you need multilanguage )
 * Widget Context
All of them can be found in WordPress plugins directory.

For multilanguage loco websites, use Widget Logic instead of Widget Context
plugin with `is_lang()` to show widget for a certain language switch.
Ex.: `!is_front_page() && is_lang("en")` will show up the widget
only on the front page and when the current language set to English.

== Credits ==
Some pals deserve kudos for tools I used here:
 * Ian Stewart for awesome Thematic (http://themeshaper.com/thematic/) under GPL.
 * Ubuntu Design Team for initial mockups and ideas: http://design.canonical.com/
 * (Agafonov) and lp:~ubuntu-ru Team for initial html work
 * Matteo Lissandrini for html port
 * lp:wordpress-loco for initial work

Currently using WordPress version at least >=2.9!
Happy loco building!
