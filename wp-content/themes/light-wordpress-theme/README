Ubuntu-LoCo port for WordPress.
===============================

Website:
  http://launchpad.net/ubuntu-website
Launchpad:
  https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-website-community/ubuntu-website/light-wordpress-theme
Bzr:
  bzr branch lp:ubuntu-website/light-wordpress-theme

This is a theme created for WordPress to be used
as the CMS engine for Ubuntu loco websites.

It uses the layout of the current (ubuntu-10.04) ubuntu 
website revised by lp:ubuntu-website team and contributors.

Theme uses Thematic Framework for WordPress. This is a child theme for
it, so It won't work without thematic installed!!!

== Credits ==
Some pals deserve kudos for tools I used here:
 * Ian Stewart for awesome Thematic (http://themeshaper.com/thematic/) under GPL.
 * Ubuntu Design Team for initial mockups and ideas: http://design.canonical.com/
 * (Agafonov) and lp:~ubuntu-ru Team for initial html work
 * Matteo Lissandrini for html port
 * lp:wordpress-loco for initial work

Currently using WordPress version at least >=2.9, though I recommend >=3.0!
Happy loco building!
